## Solved Bugs

* Fixed an error where trying to create an account with the sign up form a 400 post error would appear to fix this I imported the axiosDefaults to the app.js file which fixed this issue.
* Fixed an error where the navigation bar was not changing once the admin users logged in to fix this checked to see if the current user was the admin user if they were to render the games icon in the navigation bar otherwise hide it this line of code fixed this error.
* Fixed route error where any user could access the game url, to fix this I created a private route component and placed the game route in the app.js file inside the new private route component. Which was checking to see if the current user has the username admin to allow the user to access the game url otherwise load a page not found message which fixed this issue.
* Fixed private route errors instead of redirecting the user to the games component I redirected them to the home page if they were not the admin user which meant only the admin user could access the games page fixing this error.
