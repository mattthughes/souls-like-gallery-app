## Solved Bugs

* Fixed an error where trying to create an account with the sign up form a 400 post error would appear to fix this I imported the axiosDefaults to the app.js file which fixed this issue.
* Fixed an error where the navigation bar was not changing once the admin users logged in to fix this checked to see if the current user was the admin user if they were to render the games icon in the navigation bar otherwise hide it this line of code fixed this error.
