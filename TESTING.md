## Solved Bugs

* Fixed an error where trying to create an account with the sign up form a 400 post error would appear to fix this I imported the axiosDefaults to the app.js file which fixed this issue.
* Fixed an error where the navigation bar was not changing once the admin users logged in to fix this checked to see if the current user was the admin user if they were to render the games icon in the navigation bar otherwise hide it this line of code fixed this error.
* Fixed route error where any user could access the game url, to fix this I created a private route component and placed the game route in the app.js file inside the new private route component. Which was checking to see if the current user has the username admin to allow the user to access the game url otherwise load a page not found message which fixed this issue.
* Fixed private route errors instead of redirecting the user to the games component I redirected them to the home page if they were not the admin user which meant only the admin user could access the games page fixing this error.
* Fixed 404 and 405 errors for game create form initally when clicking create the form could not be submitted after looking at the backend urls there was a spelling mistake adjusting the spelling to match the backend url fixed this issue.
* Fixed private route error originally the admin user could not access the url, as they were being redirected like normal users.To fix this I checked if the current user was the admin user if they were to return the children props otherwise render a not found page which fixed this issue.
